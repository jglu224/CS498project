# CS498project
Our group aims to create a trivia app that can be used by anyone with an android device. The application will allow 
users to create an account that will have an associated username and password. Players can challenge themselves, their 
friends (through Bluetooth), or other users to a trivia quiz based on a specific topic. There will be a wide array of 
topics to choose from and users can also create their own quizzes for anyone to use. Users can also create flashcards 
to use for studying.This will be stored in a database. The trivia data will come from an API and the information will be 
fetched for each quiz. The application will have a simple GUI with a database in the back end. We intend to also create a 
leaderboard for users to see winners and scores.
