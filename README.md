Trivia Wizard 
This project is a trivia app that can be used by anyone with an Android device. The application will allow users to answer trivia questions in the category of their choosing. There will be a wide array of topics for the user to choose from, and users will also be allowed to pick the difficulty of their quiz. The data we are using for the trivia questions will be come from an API and information will be fetched for each quiz. There will be a score counter so that users can see how many answers they have gotten correct.
